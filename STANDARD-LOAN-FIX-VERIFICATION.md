# Standard Loan Equal Installments - Fix Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Issue:** Standard loans not calculating equal monthly payments  
**Fix:** Implemented equal payment calculation like stockvel loans  

---

## Example: R3,500 Loan Over 2 Months

### OLD CALCULATION (INCORRECT) ❌

**Month 1:**
- Outstanding Balance: R3,500
- TBFS Income (30%): R3,500 × 0.30 = R1,050
- Initiation Portion: R420 / 2 = R210
- Admin Fee: R60
- Interest: R1,050 - R210 - R60 = R780
- Principal: R3,500 / 2 = R1,750
- **Total Payment: R1,750 + R1,050 = R2,800**

**Month 2:**
- Outstanding Balance: R1,750
- TBFS Income (30%): R1,750 × 0.30 = R525
- Initiation Portion: R210
- Admin Fee: R60
- Interest: R525 - R210 - R60 = R255
- Principal: R1,750
- **Total Payment: R1,750 + R525 = R2,275**

**Problem:** Payments NOT equal (R2,800 vs R2,275) ❌

## NEW CALCULATION (CORRECT) ✅

### Step 1: Calculate Total Interest on Declining Balance

**Month 1:**
- Outstanding Balance: R3,500
- TBFS Income (30%): R3,500 × 0.30 = R1,050
- Initiation Portion: R210
- Admin Fee: R60
- Interest: R1,050 - R210 - R60 = R780

**Month 2:**
- Outstanding Balance: R1,750
- TBFS Income (30%): R1,750 × 0.30 = R525
- Initiation Portion: R210
- Admin Fee: R60
- Interest: R525 - R210 - R60 = R255

**Total Interest:** R780 + R255 = R1,035

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost

```
Principal:           R3,500.00
Total Interest:      R1,035.00
Initiation Fee (12%): R420.00
Admin Fees (2×R60):   R120.00
────────────────────────────
TOTAL COST:          R5,075.00
```

### Step 3: Calculate Equal Monthly Payment

```
Equal Payment = R5,075.00 / 2 months
Equal Payment = R2,537.50 per month ✅
```

### Payment Schedule (EQUAL PAYMENTS)

**Month 1:**
- Principal Payment: R1,750.00
- Interest: R780.00
- Admin Fee: R60.00
- Initiation Fee: R210.00
- **Total Payment: R2,537.50** ✅
- Remaining Balance: R1,750.00

**Month 2:**
- Principal Payment: R1,750.00
- Interest: R255.00
- Admin Fee: R60.00
- Initiation Fee: R210.00
- **Total Payment: R2,537.50** ✅
- Remaining Balance: R0.00

**Result:** EQUAL PAYMENTS of R2,537.50 each month ✅

## Verification

### Old System:
```
Month 1: R2,800.00
Month 2: R2,275.00
Total:   R5,075.00
```
❌ Unequal payments (difference of R525)

### New System:
```
Month 1: R2,537.50
Month 2: R2,537.50
Total:   R5,075.00
```
✅ EQUAL payments (no difference)

## Code Changes

### Location: `/workspace/index.html` lines 3019-3100

### Key Changes:

1. **Added first pass loop** - Calculate all interest on declining balance
2. **Calculate total cost** - Sum all components
3. **Calculate equal payment** - Divide total by term
4. **Second pass loop** - Build breakdown using equal payment

### New Logic:
```javascript
// First pass: Calculate total interest
for (let month = 1; month <= term; month++) {
    totalInterest += monthlyInterest
    monthlyDetails.push({ interest, adminFee, initiationFee })
    outstandingBalance -= basePrincipalPayment
}

// Calculate equal payment
totalCostStandard = principal + totalInterest + initiationFee + totalAdminFees
equalMonthlyPayment = totalCostStandard / term

// Second pass: Build breakdown with equal payments
for (let month = 1; month <= term; month++) {
    breakdown.push({
        totalPayment: equalMonthlyPayment  // Same for all months!
    })
}
```

## PWA Fix

**Service Worker Cache Version Updated:**
- Old: `v32`
- New: `v33`

This ensures browser downloads fresh code with the fix.
