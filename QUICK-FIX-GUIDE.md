## 🐛 The Error You're Seeing

```
❌ Failed to restore from cloud: No backup found in cloud
```

**Why it happens:**
- You're on a fresh device OR
- No backup has been created yet
- The old code treats this as an error (it shouldn't!)

---

## ✅ What Gets Fixed

**After deploying this fix, users will see:**

```
ℹ️ No cloud backup found yet.

💡 To create your first backup:
1. Enable "Auto-Backup" in Settings, or
2. Make any change (add/edit a loan) to trigger automatic backup, or
3. Use "Download Local Backup" to save locally first

Once created, your backup will sync across all devices!
```

Much better! 😊
