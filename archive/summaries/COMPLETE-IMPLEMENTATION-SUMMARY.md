## 📊 Complete Calculation Examples

### Standard Loan: R3,000 / 3 Months
```
Interest Period: 3 months (full term)
Interest: R900 + R600 + R300 = R1,800
Initiation: R360 (R120/month)
Admin: R180 (R60/month)
Total Cost: R5,340
Equal Payment: R1,780/month
```

### Standard Loan: R3,000 / 4 Months
```
Interest Period: 3 months (Math.ceil(4/2) = 2, min 3)
Interest: R900 + R675 + R450 = R2,025
Spread over 4 months: R506.25/month
Initiation: R360 (R90/month)
Admin: R240 (R60/month)
Total Cost: R5,625
Equal Payment: R1,406.25/month
```

### Stockvel Loan: R5,000 with R10,500 Contributions / 3 Months
```
Tier Boundaries:
  Tier 1: R0-R3,150 @ 3%
  Tier 2: R3,150-R7,875 @ 8%
  Tier 3: R7,875-R11,025 @ 15%
  Tier 4: R11,025-R11,550 @ 25%
  Tier 5: Above R11,550 @ 30%

Initiation Fee: R0 (WAIVED - loan ≤ contributions)

Month 1 Interest (R5,000 outstanding):
  First R3,150 @ 3% = R94.50
  Remaining R1,850 @ 8% = R148.00
  Tiered Total = R242.50
  
  10% Minimum = R500
  Actual Charged = R242.50 (tiered is better)
  
  Admin Fee = R60 × (1 - 0.0485) = R57.09
  
  Monthly Bonus = (R500 + R54) - (R242.50 + R57.09) = R254.41

Full Loan:
  Total Interest: R484.99
  Total Admin: ~R171
  Total Cost: R5,656
  Equal Payment: R1,885.33/month
