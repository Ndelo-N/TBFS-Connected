## 🔍 Technical Summary (TL;DR)

**Repository:** Ndelo-N/TBFS-Connected  
**Branch:** cursor/investigate-pwa-error-a866  
**Target:** main (for deployment)

**Root Cause:**
- Deployed PWA (from `main` branch) has old error handling
- HTTP 404 (no backup file yet) treated as error
- Should be informational, not error

**Fix:**
- Distinguish between HTTP status codes
- 404 → Helpful info message
- 401/403 → Specific auth/permission errors
- Others → Generic error with details

**Impact:**
- File: `index.html`
- Lines: 3744-3761
- Changes: +18 lines, -1 line
- Risk: Very low (only error handling)

**Testing:**
- ✅ All HTTP codes tested
- ✅ Messages verified
- ✅ No breaking changes
