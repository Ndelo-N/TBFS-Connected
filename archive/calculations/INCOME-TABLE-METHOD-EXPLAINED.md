# Income Table Method for Tier 5 - Complete Explanation

## 🎯 **The Problem We Solved**

### **Circular Dependency:**
```
Need effective rate → to calculate admin fee
But admin fee → affects total charges
Which affects → effective rate
→ IMPOSSIBLE! 🔄
```

## 💡 **Lindelo's Brilliant Solution**

> **"Use the effective interest of Tiers 1-4 to calculate the admin fee, then apply Income Table method to Tier 5"**

### **The Breakthrough:**
1. ✅ Calculate Tiers 1-4 interest (simple rates)
2. ✅ Use **Tiers 1-4 rate only** for admin fee
3. ✅ For Tier 5: Apply Income Table (30% = total charge)
4. ✅ Continues until loan drops below 110% threshold

**This breaks the circular dependency!** 🎯

## 📊 **Complete Example: R3,000 Loan, R1,500 Contributions, 1 Month**

### **Initial Setup:**
```
Principal: R3,000
Contributions: R1,500
Term: 1 month

Initiation Fee:
- Waived: R0 - R1,500
- Charged: R1,500 - R3,000
- Total: (R3,000 - R1,500) × 12% = R180
- Monthly: R180 / 1 = R180
```

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Tier Boundaries**
```
Based on R1,500 contributions:

Tier 1 (3%):   R0 - R450        (30% of R1,500)
Tier 2 (8%):   R450 - R1,125    (75% of R1,500)
Tier 3 (15%):  R1,125 - R1,575  (105% of R1,500)
Tier 4 (25%):  R1,575 - R1,650  (110% of R1,500)
Tier 5 (30%):  R1,650 - R3,000  (>110%)
               ↑
         Threshold = R1,650
```

**Outstanding R3,000 > R1,650 → HAS TIER 5!** ✅

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Tiers 1-4 Interest**
```
Tier 1: R450 × 3%   = R13.50
Tier 2: R675 × 8%   = R54.00
Tier 3: R450 × 15%  = R67.50
Tier 4: R75 × 25%   = R18.75
---------------------------------
Total Tiers 1-4:    = R153.75

Tiers 1-4 Amount: R1,650 (sum of tier amounts)
```

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Admin Fee (Using Tiers 1-4 Rate)**
```
Tiers 1-4 Effective Rate:
= R153.75 / R1,650
= 0.09318 (9.318%)

Admin Fee:
= 60 × (1 - 0.09318)
= 60 × 0.90682
= R54.41

KEY: This is calculated BEFORE Tier 5!
No circular dependency! 🎯
```

---

### **Step 4: Apply Income Table to Tier 5**
```
Tier 5 Amount: R3,000 - R1,650 = R1,350

30% Total Charge:
= R1,350 × 0.30
= R405.00

This R405 includes EVERYTHING (interest + fees)!
```

---

### **Step 5: Calculate Proportional Fees for Tier 5**
```
Tier 5 as % of total outstanding:
= R1,350 / R3,000
= 45%

Proportional Admin:
= R54.41 × 0.45
= R24.48

Proportional Initiation:
= R180 × 0.45
= R81.00

Total Proportional Fees: R24.48 + R81.00 = R105.48
```

---

### **Step 6: Calculate Tier 5 Interest**
```
Tier 5 Interest:
= 30% Total Charge - Proportional Fees
= R405.00 - R24.48 - R81.00
= R299.52 ✅
```

---

### **Step 7: Total Loan Charges**
```
Interest:
- Tiers 1-4:   R153.75
- Tier 5:      R299.52
- Total:       R453.27

Fees:
- Admin:       R54.41  (based on Tiers 1-4 rate)
- Initiation:  R180.00 (flat 12% on excess)

GRAND TOTAL:   R687.68
```

## 🔍 **Verification: No Circular Dependency!**

### **Traditional Approach (FAILS):**
```
1. Calculate all tiers → get total interest
2. Need effective rate → R/outstanding
3. But need admin fee → 60 × (1 - rate)
4. But admin fee affects total → back to step 1
→ CIRCULAR! ❌
```

### **New Approach (WORKS):**
```
1. Calculate Tiers 1-4 → R153.75
2. Get Tiers 1-4 rate → 153.75 / 1,650 = 9.318%
3. Calculate admin → 60 × (1 - 0.09318) = R54.41 ✅
4. Apply Income Table to Tier 5 → R299.52 ✅
5. Sum everything → DONE! ✅

NO CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY! 🎉

## 📋 **What Happens as Loan is Paid Down?**

### **Month 1: R3,000 outstanding**
- Has Tier 5 (R3,000 > R1,650)
- Admin based on Tiers 1-4 rate (9.32%)
- Tier 5 uses Income Table

### **Month 2: R2,000 outstanding** (example)
- Still has Tier 5 (R2,000 > R1,650)
- Admin based on Tiers 1-4 rate
- Tier 5 amount now smaller

### **Month 3: R1,500 outstanding** (example)
- NO Tier 5! (R1,500 < R1,650)
- Admin based on FULL effective rate
- Normal tiered calculation (no Income Table)

**The method adapts as the loan is paid down!** 🎯

## 💰 **Final Payment Breakdown (Month 1)**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Principal** | Payment | R3,000.00 |
| **Tiers 1-4 Interest** | Various rates | R153.75 |
| **Tier 5 Interest** | Income Table | R299.52 |
| **Total Interest** | | **R453.27** |
| **Admin Fee** | 60 × (1 - 0.09318) | **R54.41** |
| **Initiation** | (3k-1.5k) × 12% | **R180.00** |
| **TOTAL PAYMENT** | | **R3,687.68** |

## ✅ **Why This Works**

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Admin fee depends on Tiers 1-4 only**
   - Calculated before Tier 5
   - No circular dependency
   - Stable and deterministic

2. **Tier 5 uses Income Table**
   - 30% = total charge (like standard loans)
   - Subtracts proportional fees
   - Ensures TBFS gets exactly 30% on this portion

3. **Self-adjusting system**
   - When loan drops below 110%: no Tier 5
   - Automatically switches to normal calculation
   - Seamless transition

4. **Member benefits**
   - Lower rates on Tiers 1-4 (3%, 8%, 15%, 25%)
   - Only pays 30% on excess above 110%
   - Much better than standard loans!

## 🎊 **Comparison: Standard vs Stockvel**

### **Standard Loan (R3,000, 1 month):**
```
30% of R3,000 = R900 total charge
- Initiation: R360 (12% of full principal)
- Admin: R60 (flat)
- Interest: R900 - R360 - R60 = R480

Total: R3,000 + R480 + R60 + R360 = R3,900
```

### **Stockvel Loan (R3,000, 1 month, R1,500 contributions):**
```
Tiers 1-4: R153.75 (favorable rates!)
Tier 5: R299.52 (Income Table on excess)
Admin: R54.41 (lower due to good ratio)
Initiation: R180 (waived on R1,500!)

Total: R3,000 + R453.27 + R54.41 + R180 = R3,687.68
```

**Stockvel saves: R3,900 - R3,687.68 = R212.32 (5.4%)!** 🎉
