# 🎁 Separate Stockvel Member System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Summary

This PR implements a **complete separate stockvel member system** with independent contribution tracking, automatic bonus calculations, and membership-based loan controls. Members are now stored separately from clients, bonuses are decoupled from contributions, and the entire system is designed exactly as envisioned.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Separate Member Registry** 
- ✅ Members stored in `AppState.stockvelMembers` (independent of clients)
- ✅ Register members WITHOUT creating loans
- ✅ Member-specific fields: memberNumber, contributions, bonuses, membership dates
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations in Stockvel tab

### 2. **Contribution Tracking (Not Linked to Loans)**
- ✅ `totalContributions` tracks ONLY actual money contributed
- ✅ Members can contribute without taking loans
- ✅ Separate `stockvelReceipts` storage for history
- ✅ Complete audit trail

### 3. **Bonus System (Decoupled from Contributions)**
- ✅ Bonuses stored in `accumulatedBonus` field (separate!)
- ✅ When loan payment received: bonus → `accumulatedBonus` ONLY
- ✅ Contributions stay unchanged (not inflated)
- ✅ Bonuses can be paid out independently

### 4. **Correct Bonus Formula**
```javascript
amountDueToTBFS = tieredInterest + adminFee + initiationFee
minimumCharge = balance × 0.10

if (amountDueToTBFS < minimumCharge) {
    memberPays = minimumCharge          // Exactly 10%
    bonus = minimumCharge - amountDueToTBFS
} else {
    memberPays = amountDueToTBFS       // Tiered amount
    bonus = 0                           // No bonus
}
```

### 5. **Full-Term Interest for Stockvel**
- ✅ Interest charged for FULL loan term (not half-term)
- ✅ Allows bonuses to accumulate as contributions grow
- ✅ Later months = declining balance + rising contributions = bigger bonuses

### 6. **Membership Expiry Validation**
- ✅ Max loan term = months until membership expires
- ✅ Example: 3 months until expiry = max 3-month loan
- ✅ Prevents loans outlasting membership

### 7. **Auto-Linking Loans to Members**
- ✅ Stores `memberNumber` in loan object
- ✅ Stores `tieredRate` for bonus calculation
- ✅ Flags `isStockvelLoan` for identification
- ✅ Make Payment button automatically awards bonuses

**Month 1:**
- Balance: R5,000 | Contributions: R2,000 | Ratio: 250%
- High tier (30%) | Due: ~R1,500 | Pays: R1,500
- **No bonus** (already > 10%)

**Month 4:**
- Balance: R2,500 | Contributions: R5,000 | Ratio: 50%
- Medium tier (8%) | Due: R200 | Pays: R250 (10%)
- **Bonus: R50** ✅

**Month 6:**
- Balance: R833 | Contributions: R7,000 | Ratio: 12%
- Low tier (3%) | Due: R25 | Pays: R83.30 (10%)
- **Bonus: R58.30** ✅
