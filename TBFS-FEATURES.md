## üéÅ **STOCKVEL MEMBER SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE** *(v1.7.0)*

### **üèóÔ∏è Separate Storage Design:**

**Why Separate?**
- Members can exist WITHOUT taking loans
- Contributions tracked independently
- Bonuses never inflate contribution totals
- Clean data architecture
- Scalable for future features

### **üìä Dual Storage Model:**

#### **1. Standard Clients (`AppState.clients`):**
```javascript
{
    account_number: "2025001",
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    client_type: "standard",
    total_loans: 2,
    status: "active"
}
```
- Used for regular loan clients
- Traditional loan management
- No contribution tracking

#### **2. Stockvel Members (`AppState.stockvelMembers`):** *(NEW!)*
```javascript
{
    memberNumber: 1001,              // Unique Member ID
    name: "Jane Smith",              // Full name
    phone: "0821234567",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    membershipStartDate: "2025-10-11",
    membershipEndDate: "2026-10-11", // Auto-calculated
    monthlyContribution: 500.00,
    totalContributions: 2500.00,     // PURE contributions
    accumulatedBonus: 150.00,        // SEPARATE from contributions!
    registeredDate: "2025-10-11T08:00:00",
    status: "active"
}
```
- **INDEPENDENT of clients array**
- Can register members without creating loans
- Contributions tracked separately
- Bonuses in dedicated field

### **üîó How They Connect:**

**When Stockvel Member Takes Loan:**
```javascript
loan = {
    loan_id: 5,
    client_name: "Jane Smith",
    account_number: "2025001",      // May or may not exist in clients
    memberNumber: 1001,             // ‚Üê Links to stockvelMembers!
    tieredRate: 0.0485,             // ‚Üê For bonus calculation
    isStockvelLoan: true,           // ‚Üê Flag for identification
    // ... other loan fields
}
```

**When Payment Made:**
1. System finds loan by loan_id
2. Checks if `loan.memberNumber` exists
3. If yes, finds member: `AppState.stockvelMembers.find(m => m.memberNumber === loan.memberNumber)`
4. Calculates bonus: `bonus = (balance √ó 0.10) - amountDueToTBFS`
5. Awards to: `member.accumulatedBonus` (NOT to totalContributions!)
6. Records in: `AppState.stockvelReceipts`

### **üí∞ Contribution vs Bonus Tracking:**

**Contributions (`totalContributions`):**
- ‚úÖ Actual money member contributed
- ‚úÖ Used for tiered rate calculations
- ‚úÖ Never inflated by bonuses
- ‚úÖ Increased only by: contributions, adjustments
- ‚úÖ Shown in member registry

**Bonuses (`accumulatedBonus`):**
- ‚úÖ Rewards earned from loan payments
- ‚úÖ **NOT added to contributions**
- ‚úÖ Tracked completely separately
- ‚úÖ Can be paid out anytime
- ‚úÖ Shown separately in registry

**Example Flow:**
```
Member starts: totalContributions = R2,000, accumulatedBonus = R0

Records contribution: totalContributions = R2,500, accumulatedBonus = R0
Takes loan & makes payment: totalContributions = R2,500, accumulatedBonus = R200
Receives bonus payout: totalContributions = R2,500, accumulatedBonus = R0

Notice: Contributions NEVER change from bonuses!
```

### **üìã Receipt Types:**

**Stored in `AppState.stockvelReceipts`:**

1. **"contribution"** - Regular monthly contribution
   - Increases `totalContributions`
   - No bonus

2. **"loan_payment"** - Payment with bonus
   - `bonusAmount` ‚Üí `accumulatedBonus`

3. **"bonus_payout"** - Paying out bonuses
   - Decreases `accumulatedBonus`
   - Contributions unchanged

4. **"adjustment"** - Manual correction
   - Can increase/decrease `totalContributions`
   - No bonus

### **üéØ Key Principles:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Members ‚â† Clients
   - Contributions ‚â† Bonuses
   - Loans link to both if needed

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Contributions always accurate
   - Bonuses never inflate totals
   - Clean audit trails

3. **Flexibility**
   - Members without loans ‚úÖ
   - Clients without memberships ‚úÖ
   - Both can coexist ‚úÖ

4. **Scalability**

## üéä **v1.7.0 MAJOR UPGRADE SUMMARY**

### **What Changed:**

**Before v1.7.0:**
- Stockvel members were clients with `isStockvelMember` flag
- Bonuses added to contribution totals (inflated numbers)
- Couldn't register members without creating loans
- Half-term interest for stockvel (missed bonus opportunities)
- No membership-based loan controls

**After v1.7.0:** ‚ú®
- ‚úÖ **Separate member registry** (`stockvelMembers` array)
- ‚úÖ **Bonuses tracked independently** (accumulatedBonus field)
- ‚úÖ **Register members anytime** (no loan required)
- ‚úÖ **Full-term interest** (more bonus opportunities)
- ‚úÖ **Membership expiry validation** (prevents overextension)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic bonus calculation** (on every payment)
- ‚úÖ **Pure contribution tracking** (accurate financial data)

### **Impact:**

**For Members:**
- Join stockvel without taking loans
- Contributions = actual money put in
- Bonuses = separate rewards
- Earn bonuses throughout full loan term
- Protected by membership expiry limits

**For TBFS:**
- Clean data separation
- Accurate financial tracking
- Independent member management
- Scalable architecture
- Better business intelligence

### **The Big Win:**

**Member contributes R500/month for 6 months = R3,000 contributions**

Then takes R5,000 loan:
- **OLD System:** After payment with R200 bonus ‚Üí contributions show R3,200 (confusing!)
- **NEW System:** After payment with R200 bonus ‚Üí contributions stay R3,000, bonus shows R200 (clear!)

**Result:** Crystal clear separation, accurate tracking, professional management! üéØ
