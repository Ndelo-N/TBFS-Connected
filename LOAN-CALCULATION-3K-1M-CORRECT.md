# Stockvel Loan: R3,000 for 1 Month (CORRECT CALCULATION)

## Scenario
- **Loan:** R3,000
- **Term:** 1 month  
- **Initial Contributions:** R1,500
- **Monthly Contribution:** R500

---

## 🎯 **INITIATION FEE - Calculated ONCE at Loan Start**

### ✅ The Correct Rule (As Per Lindelo):

> **"The initiation fee is waived for up to the value of the total contribution at the beginning of the loan, and the excess is charged at 12%: (3k - 1.5k) × 12% and is spread over the loan period"**

### Calculation:
```
Step 1: Check if waiver applies
principal = R3,000
totalContributions = R1,500

IF principal > totalContributions:
   excessAmount = R3,000 - R1,500 = R1,500
   totalInitiation = R1,500 × 12% = R180 ✅
ELSE:
   totalInitiation = R0 (fully waived)

Step 2: Spread over loan period
term = 1 month
monthlyInitiation = R180 / 1 = R180 per month ✅
```

**KEY POINT:** The zone logic (waiver vs charged) is applied **ONCE** here at loan start. The R180 is the correct amount based on the R1,500 excess.

---

## 📊 **TIER BREAKDOWN**

### Tier Boundaries (based on R1,500 savings):
```
Tier 1 (3%):   R0 - R450        = R450
Tier 2 (8%):   R450 - R1,125    = R675
Tier 3 (15%):  R1,125 - R1,575  = R450
Tier 4 (25%):  R1,575 - R1,650  = R75
Tier 5 (30%):  R1,650 - R3,000  = R1,350 ← Income Table method
```

---

## 💰 **TIER 5 CALCULATION (Income Table Method)**

### Tier 5 Amount: R1,350

**Proportional Fee Allocation:**
```
Tier 5 as % of total: R1,350 / R3,000 = 45%

Proportional Initiation:
= monthlyInitiation × tierProportion
= R180 × 0.45
= R81 ✅

Proportional Admin:
= R60 × 0.45
= R27 ✅

NOTE: We use SIMPLE proportion here because the 
initiation fee (R180) was ALREADY calculated with 
zone awareness at the loan start!
```

**Income Table Method:**
```
30% Total Charge = R1,350 × 0.30 = R405.00

Subtract fees:
  - Initiation: R81 (45% of monthly R180)
  - Admin:      R27 (45% of monthly R60)
  
Tier 5 Interest = R405 - R81 - R27 = R297.00 ✅
```

## 📋 **COMPLETE TIERED INTEREST CALCULATION**

| Tier | Amount | Rate | Method | Interest |
|------|--------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | R450 | 3% | Simple | R13.50 |
| 2 | R675 | 8% | Simple | R54.00 |
| 3 | R450 | 15% | Simple | R67.50 |
| 4 | R75 | 25% | Simple | R18.75 |
| 5 | R1,350 | 30% | **Income Table** | **R297.00** |
| **TOTAL** | R3,000 | | | **R450.75** |

**Effective Interest Rate:** 450.75 / 3,000 = **15.025%**

---

## 🔍 **BONUS CALCULATION CHECK**

### 10% Minimum Check:
```
Tiered Interest: R450.75 (15.025%)
10% Minimum:     R300.00

Tiered > Minimum ✅ Use tiered rate
```

### Admin Fee:
```
Based on 15.025% effective rate
Admin = R60 × (1 - 0.15025) = R50.99 ✅
```

### Total Charges vs Minimum:
```
Tiered Charges:
- Interest: R450.75
- Admin:    R50.99
- Initiation: R180.00
- TOTAL:    R681.74

10% Minimum Charges:
- Interest: R300.00
- Admin:    R60.00
- Initiation: R180.00
- TOTAL:    R540.00

Bonus = R681.74 - R540.00 = R141.74?
```

**WAIT!** This needs bonus logic verification - if tiered > minimum, no bonus! ✅

## 💳 **FINAL PAYMENT BREAKDOWN**

| Component | Amount | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Principal** | R3,000.00 | Full repayment |
| **Interest** | R450.75 | Tiered (15.025%) |
| **Admin Fee** | R50.99 | R60 × (1 - 0.15025) |
| **Initiation** | R180.00 | (R3k - R1.5k) × 12% |
| **Bonus** | R0 | Tiered > minimum → no bonus |
| **TOTAL** | **R3,681.74** | **One payment** |

## 🔄 **WHY THIS IS CORRECT**

### The Two-Step Process:

**Step 1: Initiation Fee (At Loan Start)**
```
✅ Calculate ONCE with zone awareness
✅ (principal - contributions) × 12%
✅ R180 = correct amount for R1,500 excess
✅ Spread over term: R180 / 1 = R180/month
```

**Step 2: Tier Allocation (During Calculation)**
```
✅ Allocate by SIMPLE proportion
✅ Tier 5 = 45% of outstanding balance
✅ Gets 45% of monthly initiation = R81
✅ Don't re-check zones (that was Step 1!)
```

### ❌ **Common Error (What I Initially Did Wrong):**
```
❌ Re-checking zones during tier allocation
❌ "Tier 5 starts at R1,650 > R1,500 → 100% charged"
❌ Allocated R180 × 1.0 = R180 to Tier 5
❌ This DOUBLE-COUNTS the zone logic!
```

### ✅ **Correct Approach:**
```
✅ Zone logic applied ONCE at loan start
✅ Then simple proportion for tier allocation
✅ R180 × 0.45 = R81 to Tier 5
✅ Single application of zone logic
```

Principal:     R3,000.00
Interest:      R450.75 (tiered across 5 tiers)
Admin:         R50.99 (variable based on rate)
Initiation:    R180.00 (12% on R1,500 excess)
---------------
Total Payment: R3,681.74 ✅
```

### Compared to Standard Loan (R3k, 1 month):
```
Standard (30% Income Table): ~R3,870
Stockvel (Tiered):           R3,681.74
Savings:                     ~R188 (4.9%)
```
