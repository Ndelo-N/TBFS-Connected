📊 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
  ❌ Error Message: "Failed to restore from cloud: No backup found in cloud"
  
  Location: ndelo-n.github.io (deployed PWA)
  
  Root Cause: Deployed version (from 'main' branch) has old error 
              handling that treats HTTP 404 (no backup file exists yet)
              as an error instead of a normal first-time scenario

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  • Repository: Ndelo-N/TBFS-Connected
  • Deployment: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
  • Deploy Trigger: Push to 'main' branch
  • File Affected: index.html (CloudBackup.restore function)
  • Current Deploy: Has old error handling code
  • This Branch: Has the fix implemented

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE FIX (Already in This Branch):
  
  ✅ HTTP 404 (No Backup Yet)
