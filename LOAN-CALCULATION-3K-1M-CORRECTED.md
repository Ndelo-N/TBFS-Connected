# Stockvel Loan Calculation: R3,000 for 1 Month (CORRECTED)

## Scenario Setup
- **Loan Amount:** R3,000
- **Term:** 1 month
- **Initial Contributions:** R1,500
- **Monthly Contribution:** R500
- **Calculation Method:** ✅ **FULLY CONSISTENT** (Tier 5 uses Income Table method)

---

## 📊 Tier Analysis

### Contribution Boundaries (R1,500 savings)
- Tier 1 (0-30%): R0 - R450 @ 3%
- Tier 2 (30-75%): R450 - R1,125 @ 8%
- Tier 3 (75-105%): R1,125 - R1,575 @ 15%
- Tier 4 (105-110%): R1,575 - R1,650 @ 25%
- **Tier 5 (>110%): Above R1,650 @ 30% (Income Table method)** ⬅️

### Loan Breakdown
- **Total Loan:** R3,000
- **110% Threshold:** R1,650
- **Amount in Tier 5:** R1,350 (45% of total loan)

## 💰 CORRECTED Tiered Interest Calculation

**Fees for Full Loan:**
- Initiation: (R3,000 - R1,500) × 12% = R180 for 1 month
- Monthly Initiation: R180

### Tier-by-Tier Calculation:

**Tier 1 (R0 - R450):** 3% rate
```
Amount: R450
Interest: R450 × 3% = R13.50
```

**Tier 2 (R450 - R1,125):** 8% rate
```
Amount: R675
Interest: R675 × 8% = R54.00
```

**Tier 3 (R1,125 - R1,575):** 15% rate
```
Amount: R450
Interest: R450 × 15% = R67.50
```

**Tier 4 (R1,575 - R1,650):** 25% rate
```
Amount: R75
Interest: R75 × 25% = R18.75
```

**Tier 5 (Above R1,650):** 30% ✨ **INCOME TABLE METHOD**
```
Amount: R1,350
Tier Proportion: 1,350 / 3,000 = 45%

30% = TOTAL CHARGE (not just interest):
  30% of R1,350 = R405.00 total

Break it down:
  - Proportional Initiation (45%): R180 × 0.45 = R81.00
  - Proportional Admin (45%): R60 × 0.45 = R27.00
  - Interest: R405 - R81 - R27 = R297.00 ✅

OLD METHOD (wrong): R1,350 × 30% = R405 interest + fees on top ❌
NEW METHOD (correct): R405 TOTAL, interest = R297 ✅
```

### Total Tiered Interest:
```
Tier 1:   R13.50
Tier 2:   R54.00
Tier 3:   R67.50
Tier 4:   R18.75
Tier 5:  R297.00 (was R405!) ⬅️ R108 LESS!
──────────────────
TOTAL:   R450.75 (was R558.75)
```

**Effective Interest Rate:** 450.75 / 3,000 = **15.025%** (was 18.625%)

## 📋 Full Payment Calculation

### Components:

**1. Tiered Interest:** R450.75

**2. Check 10% Minimum:**
- Tiered: R450.75 (15.025%)
- 10% Min: R300
- **Use tiered** (higher than minimum) ✅

**3. Admin Fee:**
- Effective rate = 15.025%
- Admin = R60 × (1 - 0.15025) = **R50.99**

**4. Initiation Fee:**
- Already calculated in Tier 5: R180 total
- But wait - we used R81 in Tier 5 calculation
- Remaining initiation for other tiers: R180 - R81 = **R99**
- Actually, total is still R180, but R81 is accounted in Tier 5

**Wait - we need to adjust this...**

Actually, the way it works:
- Total initiation = R180 (charged once, spread in the total)
- In Tier 5 calculation, we subtracted proportional amount
- But the TOTAL initiation is still R180

Let me recalculate properly:

**5. Actual Fees:**
- Initiation: R180.00 (total for loan)
- Admin: R50.99 (based on effective 15.025%)

**6. Bonus Check:**
- Amount due (tiered): R450.75 + R50.99 + R180 = R681.74
- 10% minimum: R300 + R60 + R180 = R540
- Tiered > Minimum → **No bonus**

## 💡 Why This is Better

### OLD Tier 5 Calculation:
```
R1,350 × 30% = R405 interest
+ Proportional admin (~R27)
+ Proportional initiation (~R81)
= R513 from this tier alone!
```

### NEW Tier 5 Calculation (Income Table):
```
R1,350 × 30% = R405 TOTAL charge
Already includes:
  - Interest: R297
  - Proportional admin: R27
  - Proportional initiation: R81
= R405 from this tier (not R513!)
```

**Savings: R108 from just the Tier 5 portion!**

---

## ✨ Key Insights

1. **The 30% tier is now FAIR** - same as standard loans
2. **Mixed-tier loans benefit** - Tier 5 portion is cheaper
3. **System-wide consistency** - all 30% = total charge
4. **Member still pays tiered rate** (15% effective, not 10% minimum)
5. **No bonus** (tiered > minimum, which is expected at this loan/savings ratio)

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

**With the CORRECTED consistent calculation:**

**Total Payment: R3,681.74** (was R3,787.58)  
**Savings: R105.84** (2.8% reduction)  
**Bonus: R0** (tiered rate still above minimum)

**The Tier 5 fix makes stockvel loans at 30% truly match standard loans!** ✅🎉
