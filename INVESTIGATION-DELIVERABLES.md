## 🔍 Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
```javascript
// OLD CODE (Main Branch - Currently Deployed)
if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('No backup found in cloud');  // ❌ Too generic
}

// NEW CODE (This Branch - Fix Ready)
if (!response.ok) {
    if (response.status === 404) {
        // Helpful informational message
        alert('ℹ️ No cloud backup found yet...');
        return;  // Graceful exit
    } else if (response.status === 401) {
        throw new Error('Authentication failed. Check your GitHub token');
    } else if (response.status === 403) {
        throw new Error('Access denied. Verify repository permissions');
    } else {
        throw new Error(`Unable to access cloud backup (Error ${response.status})`);
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Improvements
| HTTP Status | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|

| 403 (No permission) | ❌ Generic error | ❌ Specific permission message |
