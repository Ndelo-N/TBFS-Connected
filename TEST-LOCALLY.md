# How to Test the Fixes Locally

## The Issue
You're testing on GitHub Pages (https://ndelo-n.github.io/TBFS-Connected/), but the fixes are only in your local workspace. GitHub Pages shows the old broken version.

## Quick Test - Open Local File

### Windows:
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type: `explorer .` (opens current folder)
3. **Double-click `index.html`** - opens in your default browser
4. Test tabs and swipe - should work now!

### Alternative - Direct Path:
1. Open your browser
2. Press `Ctrl + O` (Open File)
3. Navigate to: `/workspace/index.html`
4. Click Open

### Mac/Linux:
1. In terminal: `open index.html` (Mac) or `xdg-open index.html` (Linux)
2. Or drag `index.html` into your browser window

## What You'll See
✅ **No console errors** - The "Cannot read properties of undefined" error should be gone
✅ **Tabs work** - Click any tab to switch
✅ **Swipe works** - Swipe left/right on mobile
✅ **Stockvel loads** - Dashboard displays without crashing

## To Deploy to GitHub Pages
The fixes need to be committed and pushed to GitHub. Since this is a background agent environment, you'll need to:

1. Review the changes in this branch
2. Merge the branch to main (or create a PR)
3. Push to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages will auto-update in ~1 minute

## Verify Fixes Are Local
Run this in terminal:
```bash
grep -n "const bonusAmount = (r.bonusAmount" index.html
```

Should show:
```
4317:                const bonusAmount = (r.bonusAmount || r.bonusAdded || 0); // Support both field names
```

If you see that line, the fixes are definitely in your local file! ✅
