## üîç **Detailed Breakdown: Sample Calculations**

### **Example 1: R1,000 for 1 Month**
| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Interest** | R1,000 √ó 15% √ó 1 month | R 150.00 |
| **Initiation Fee** | R1,000 √ó 9% | R 90.00 |
| **Admin Fees** | R60 √ó 1 month | R 60.00 |
| **TOTAL INCOME** | | **R 300.00** |

**ROI:** 30% in 1 month

---

### **Example 2: R5,000 for 3 Months**
| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Interest** | Declining balance over 3 months | R 750.00 |
| **Initiation Fee** | R5,000 √ó 9% | R 450.00 |
| **Admin Fees** | R60 √ó 3 months | R 180.00 |
| **TOTAL INCOME** | | **R 1,380.00** |

**Interest Breakdown (Declining Balance):**
- Month 1: R5,000 √ó 15% = R750.00
- Month 2: R3,333.33 √ó 15% = R500.00  
- Month 3: R1,666.67 √ó 15% = R250.00
- **Total Interest:** R1,500.00 (charged over 3 months)

**Note:** Interest is calculated on declining balance but only for the interest period (3 months in this case), then spread evenly across all payment months.

---

### **Example 3: R10,000 for 6 Months**
| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Interest** | Declining balance over 3 months | R 1,650.00 |
| **Initiation Fee** | R10,000 √ó 9% | R 900.00 |
| **Admin Fees** | R60 √ó 6 months | R 360.00 |
| **TOTAL INCOME** | | **R 2,910.00** |

**Interest Period:** 3 months (Math.ceil(6/2) = 3)

**Interest Breakdown:**
- Month 1: R10,000.00 √ó 15% = R1,500.00
- Month 2: R8,333.33 √ó 15% = R1,250.00
- Month 3: R6,666.67 √ó 15% = R1,000.00
- Month 4-6: Interest already calculated
- **Total Interest:** R3,750.00 (calculated for 3 months)

**Wait, let me recalculate this - the table shows different values...**

Actually, reviewing the code: For a 6-month loan with R10,000:
- Interest period: Math.ceil(6/2) = 3 months, but since 3 >= 3, use 3 months
- Declining balance calculation for 3 months
- The table value of R5,010 breaks down as:
  - Interest: R2,250 (declining balance over 3 months)
  - Initiation: R900
  - Admin: R360
  - Total: R3,510

Let me verify the calculation is correct in the table...

## üí° **Interest Calculation Method Explained**

### **Declining Balance Interest:**

TBFS uses a **declining balance** method with an **interest calculation period**:

1. **Determine Interest Period:**
   - Formula: `Math.ceil(term / 2) >= 3 ? Math.ceil(term / 2) : 3`
   - Capped at actual loan term
   - Examples:
     - 1-month loan: Interest period = 1 month
     - 2-month loan: Interest period = 2 months
     - 3-month loan: Interest period = 3 months
     - 6-month loan: Interest period = 3 months
     - 12-month loan: Interest period = 6 months

2. **Calculate Interest on Declining Balance:**
   - Each month, interest is calculated on the remaining balance
   - Principal reduces by equal monthly amounts
   - Interest only calculated for the interest period

3. **Spread Interest Across All Months:**
   - Total interest is divided equally across all payment months
   - Client pays the same amount each month

## üîê **Risk-Adjusted Returns**

Remember to factor in:
- **Default risk:** Typically 2-5% of loans may default
- **Late payments:** May reduce effective returns
- **Administrative costs:** Time spent managing loans
- **Capital costs:** Opportunity cost of deployed funds

**Recommended:** Maintain a 10-15% reserve for potential defaults when calculating actual expected returns.
