## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Standard Loan Equal Installments Fixed

**Issue:** Standard loans were not calculating equal monthly payments, causing confusion for clients.

**Example Problem (R3,500 / 2 months):**
```
BEFORE (Incorrect):
  Month 1: R2,800.00
  Month 2: R2,275.00
  ❌ Payments NOT equal (difference of R525)
```

**Solution:**
```
AFTER (Correct):
  Month 1: R2,537.50
  Month 2: R2,537.50
  ✅ Payments EQUAL (no difference)
```

**Technical Details:**
- Changed calculation to use two-pass method
- First pass: Calculate total TBFS income on declining balance
- Second pass: Divide total cost by term for equal payments
- Maintains detailed breakdown for tracking and allocation

**Files Changed:**
- `/workspace/index.html` (lines 3043-3099)
- `/workspace/sw.js` (cache version v32 → v33)

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Standard Loan Calculation (30% Income Table Method)

**Step 1: Calculate Total TBFS Income**
```javascript
Month 1: R3,500 × 0.30 = R1,050
Month 2: R1,750 × 0.30 = R525
Total TBFS Income: R1,575
```

**Step 2: Break Down Components**
```javascript
Initiation Fee: R3,500 × 0.12 = R420
Admin Fees: R60 × 2 = R120
Interest: R1,575 - R420 - R120 = R1,035
```

**Step 3: Calculate Equal Payment**
```javascript
Total Cost: R3,500 + R1,575 = R5,075
Equal Payment: R5,075 / 2 = R2,537.50
```

**Step 4: Build Detailed Breakdown**
```javascript
Month 1:
  Principal: R1,750
  Interest: R780 (declining balance calculation)
  Admin: R60
  Initiation: R210
  Total: R2,537.50 ✅

Month 2:
  Principal: R1,750
  Interest: R255 (declining balance calculation)
  Admin: R60
  Initiation: R210
  Total: R2,537.50 ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Location:** `/workspace/index.html` lines 3043-3099

**Before:**
```javascript
breakdown.push({
    totalPayment: basePrincipalPayment + tbfsIncome,  // ❌ Not equal
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
// First pass: Calculate totals
for (let month = 1; month <= term; month++) {
    totalInterest += monthlyInterest;
    monthlyDetails.push({...});
}

// Calculate equal payment
const equalMonthlyPayment = totalCostStandard / term;

// Second pass: Build breakdown
breakdown.push({
    totalPayment: equalMonthlyPayment,  // ✅ Equal each month
});
```

### Cache Update

**File:** `/workspace/sw.js` line 1

**Before:**
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'tbfs-loan-manager-v32';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'tbfs-loan-manager-v33'; // v1.7.5 - Fix: Standard loan equal installments
```

## 📖 Clarifications Made

### Standard Loan Calculation

**What Users See:**
- "30% monthly charge" = Total TBFS income
- Equal payments every month
- Simple, predictable

**What System Tracks:**
- Interest (calculated on declining balance)
- Admin fees (R60/month)
- Initiation fee (12% spread over term)
- Detailed breakdown for reporting

### Stockvel Tier 5 Method

**Clarified:**
- Tier 5 uses Income Table method (same as standard loans!)
- This is why loans >110% of contributions are expensive
- Tiers 1-4: Favorable simple rates (3%-25%)
- Tier 5: Standard 30% Income Table method
- Hybrid approach: Best of both worlds

**Example:**
```
R30,000 loan with R10,500 contributions:
- First R11,550 (38.5%): Uses favorable tiers 1-4
- Remaining R18,450 (61.5%): Uses Tier 5 (30% method)
- Still better than 100% at 30% (standard loan)
```
