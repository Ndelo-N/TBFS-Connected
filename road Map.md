**Cost:** $75-150/month  
**NEW INFRASTRUCTURE:**

**You'll know you need this when:**
- 1000+ active loans

- Regulatory scrutiny
- White-label licensing

---

## **💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:**

### **SHORT TERM (Next 3-6 months):**
**STAY ON FREE TIER**
- Build v1.5 (Reports) - NO NEW COSTS
- Start v1.6 with manual workarounds (copy-paste reminders)
- Test market demand before paying for infrastructure

### **DECISION POINT #1 (Q2 2026):**
**Question:** Are manual reminders too tedious?
- **YES** → Invest in light backend ($20-40/month) for automation
- **NO** → Stay free, keep manual workflow

### **DECISION POINT #2 (Q3-Q4 2026):**
**Question:** Do you need multiple users/agents?
- **YES** → Invest in full backend ($75-150/month) for v2.0
- **NO** → Delay v2.0, focus on v2.2 (payments) or v2.3 (products)

### **DECISION POINT #3 (2027):**
**Question:** Is this a real business with revenue > $10k/month?
- **YES** → Invest in proper infrastructure, it's justified
- **NO** → Stay lean, reconsider business model

---

## **🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION:**

### **Phase 1: Maximize Free Tier (Now - Mid 2026)**
Build v1.5, v2.3 (loan products) - both work on current setup
- **Cost:** $0
- **Risk:** None
- **Benefit:** More features, no new expenses

### **Phase 2: Add Light Automation (Mid 2026)**
When manual reminders become painful, add v1.6 automation
- **Cost:** $20-40/month
- **Risk:** Low
- **Benefit:** Save hours of manual work

### **Phase 3: Scale Decision (Late 2026)**
If business is growing (50+ active clients, hiring help), invest in v2.0
- **Cost:** $75-150/month
- **Risk:** Medium (monthly commitment)
- **Benefit:** Team scaling, professional operations

### **Phase 4: Payment Integration (2027)**
When transaction volume justifies it, add v2.2 payment processing
- **Cost:** Transaction fees only (2-3%)
- **Risk:** Low (pay per transaction)
- **Benefit:** Convenience, faster payments

---

## **📋 INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSITION CHECKLIST:**

**BEFORE investing in backend, ensure:**
- [ ] Current app is being used actively (daily)
- [ ] Free tier limitations are actually painful (not theoretical)
- [ ] Monthly revenue covers infrastructure costs 5-10x
