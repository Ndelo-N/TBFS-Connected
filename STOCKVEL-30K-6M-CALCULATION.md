**Tier Boundaries:**
- Tier 1: R0-R4,050 @ 3%

Admin Fee: R60 √ó (1 - 0.0932) = R54.41

Tier 5 Amount: R150
Tier 5 Charge (30%): R45.00
Tier 5 Interest: R45 - R54.41 - R390 = NEGATIVE!

Wait, this is a problem. The Tier 5 income table method doesn't work here.
Let me recalculate...

Actually, looking at the code, when Tier 5 interest calculation would be negative,
the system should handle it differently. Let me check the code logic...

Actually, Tier 5 interest = 30% charge - admin - initiation
If that's negative, we just get the tiered interest from Tiers 1-4 and Tier 5 simple:

Tier 5: R150 √ó 30% = R45.00 (simple calculation)

Total Tiered Interest: R1,383.75 + R45.00 = R1,428.75 (9.53%)
10% Minimum: R1,500.00
Actual Interest: R1,500.00 ‚úì (minimum higher!)
```

**Bonus Calculation:**
```
Amount Due to TBFS: R1,428.75 + R54.41 + R390 = R1,873.16
Minimum Charge: R1,500 + R60 + R390 = R1,950.00
Bonus: R1,950.00 - R1,873.16 = R76.84 üéÅ
```

**Month 4 Payment Components:**
- Principal: R5,000
- Interest: R1,500.00 (10% minimum)
- Admin: R60.00 (minimum applied)
- Initiation: R390
- Bonus: R76.84
