# Stockvel Loan Top-Up Fix - Tier Recalculation

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** When stockvel members topped up their loans using "Adjust Loan" → "Increase Loan Amount", the system:
- ❌ Just added R1 interest per R1 principal (1:1 ratio)
- ❌ Did NOT recalculate tiered rates based on new total
- ❌ Allowed gaming the system by staying in low tiers

**Solution:** Implemented tier recalculation for stockvel loan top-ups
- ✅ Recalculates ALL tiers based on NEW total loan amount
- ✅ Uses algebraic admin fee calculation (no circular dependency)
- ✅ Applies proper stockvel initiation fee rules
- ✅ Maintains mathematical integrity

## 📊 Test Scenario: Your Exact Example

### **Customer Profile:**
- **Contributions:** R9,000
- **Member Type:** Stockvel

---

### **Step 1: Initial R2,000 Loan**

**Calculation:**
```
Loan Amount: R2,000
Contributions: R9,000
Ratio: R2,000 / R9,000 = 22.2%

Tier Assignment:
└── Tier 1 (0-30% of R9,000): R2,000 @ 3% = R60/month

Results:
├── Interest (monthly): R60
├── Admin Fee: 60 × (1 - 0.03) = R58.20
├── Initiation Fee: R0 (waived - loan < contributions)
└── Total: R2,000 principal + interest
```

---

### **Step 2: Top-Up R2,000 (OLD BEHAVIOR - BROKEN)**

❌ **What Used to Happen:**
```
Just adds R2,000:
├── New Principal: R4,000
├── Max Interest: OLD + R2,000 = R2,060
├── Initiation: R2,000 × 9% = R180
└── NO tier recalculation!

Problem: Still using Tier 1 rate from original R2,000 loan
```

---

### **Step 2: Top-Up R2,000 (NEW BEHAVIOR - FIXED)**

✅ **What Happens Now:**
```
NEW TOTAL: R4,000
Contributions: R9,000
Ratio: R4,000 / R9,000 = 44.4%

Tier Recalculation:
├── Tier 1 (0-30% = R2,700): R2,700 × 3% = R81.00
├── Tier 2 (30-44% = R1,300): R1,300 × 8% = R104.00
└── Total Tiered Interest: R185.00/month

10% Minimum Check:
├── Tiered: R185.00 (4.625%)
├── Minimum: R400.00 (10%)
└── Use: R400.00 (higher) ✓

Admin Fee (if Tier 5 existed - algebraic):
├── Formula: 60 × [balance - tiers1-4 - (tier5 × 0.30) + initFee] / (balance - 60)
└── In this case: Based on Tiers 1-2 rate

Initiation Fee (Stockvel rules):
├── Amount above contributions: R4,000 - R9,000 = R0 (loan still < contributions)
└── Initiation Fee: R0 (waived)

Final Monthly Charges:
├── Interest: R400.00 (10% minimum)
├── Admin Fee: ~R60 (variable based on rate)
├── Initiation: R0
└── Total: R460/month
```

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Aspect | OLD (Broken) | NEW (Fixed) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tier Calculation** | Uses original R2,000 tiers | Recalculates for R4,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | 3% (Tier 1) | 10% minimum applied |
| **Admin Fee** | Based on old rate | Recalculated properly |
| **Initiation Fee** | 9% standard | 12% stockvel (waived if < contributions) |
| **Gaming Vulnerability** | ✅ YES - exploitable | ❌ NO - fixed |

## 🛡️ Anti-Gaming Protection

### **Scenario: Member Tries to Game System**

**Attempt:**
1. Take R2,000 loan (Tier 1 @ 3%)
2. Top-up R2,000 (expects another Tier 1)
3. Top-up R2,000 again
4. Goal: Borrow R10,000+ at 3% rate

**OLD System:**
```
✅ Would work!
- Each top-up just adds interest
- No tier recalculation
- Member stays at 3% forever
```

**NEW System:**
```
❌ Prevented!
Top-up #1: R4,000 total → Tier 2 (8%)
Top-up #2: R6,000 total → Tier 3 (15%)
Top-up #3: R8,000 total → Tier 3 (15%)
Top-up #4: R10,000 total → Tier 4 (25%)

Each top-up recalculates tiers based on NEW total
Member pays fair rates based on exposure
```

## 💻 Implementation Details

### **Code Changes:**

1. **Detect Stockvel Loans:**
```javascript
if (loan.isStockvelLoan) {
    // Use tier recalculation logic
} else {
    // Use standard 1:1 logic
}
```

2. **Get Member Contributions:**
```javascript
const client = AppState.clients.find(c => c.account_number === loan.account_number);
const totalContributions = client?.total_contributions || 0;
```

3. **Recalculate Tiers:**
```javascript
const newPrincipal = oldPrincipal + amount;
const tieredResult = calculateTieredStockvelInterest(newPrincipal, totalContributions);
```

4. **Algebraic Admin Fee:**
```javascript
if (tier5Amount > 0) {
    const numerator = 60 * (newPrincipal - tiers1to4Interest - (tier5Amount * 0.30) + monthlyInitiationFee);
    const denominator = newPrincipal - 60;
    adminFee = numerator / denominator;
}
```

5. **Stockvel Initiation Fee:**
```javascript
if (newPrincipal <= totalContributions) {
    totalInitiationFee = 0; // Waived
} else {
    totalInitiationFee = (newPrincipal - totalContributions) * 0.12;
}
```
