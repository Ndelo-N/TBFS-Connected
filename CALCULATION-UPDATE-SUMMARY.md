# TBFS Calculation Update Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Branch:** cursor/update-loan-and-stockvel-calculations-c11f  
**Version:** 2.0 (FINAL)

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Standard Loan Calculations (REVISED v2.0)**

#### New Calculation Method:
- **Interest Period:**
  - Loans ≤ 3 months: Full term
  - Loans > 3 months: Math.ceil(term/2) with minimum of 3 months
- **Interest Rate:** 30% per month on declining balance
- **Total Initiation Fee** = 12% of principal (distributed evenly over term)
- **Admin Fee** = R60 per month
- **Monthly Payment** = EQUAL amount each month (Total Cost ÷ Term)

#### Example: R3,000 loan over 3 months
```
Interest Period: 3 months (≤ 3, so full term)

Interest Calculation (declining balance):
  Month 1: R3,000 × 30% = R900
  Month 2: R2,000 × 30% = R600
  Month 3: R1,000 × 30% = R300
  Total Interest: R1,800

Spread interest evenly: R1,800 ÷ 3 = R600 per month
Total Initiation Fee: R360 (R120 per month)
Total Admin Fees: R180 (R60 per month)
Total Cost: R3,000 + R1,800 + R360 + R180 = R5,340
Equal Monthly Payment: R5,340 ÷ 3 = R1,780

Monthly Breakdown:
Month 1: R1,000 (principal) + R600 (interest) + R120 (init) + R60 (admin) = R1,780
Month 2: R1,000 (principal) + R600 (interest) + R120 (init) + R60 (admin) = R1,780
Month 3: R1,000 (principal) + R600 (interest) + R120 (init) + R60 (admin) = R1,780

TOTALS:
  Total Interest: R1,800
  Total Initiation Fee: R360
  Total Admin Fees: R180
  Total Paid: R5,340
```

#### Example: R3,000 loan over 4 months
```
Interest Period: 3 months (Math.ceil(4/2) = 2, but min is 3)

Interest Calculation (declining balance):
  Month 1: R3,000 × 30% = R900.00
  Month 2: R2,250 × 30% = R675.00
  Month 3: R1,500 × 30% = R450.00
  Total Interest: R2,025.00

Spread interest evenly: R2,025 ÷ 4 = R506.25 per month
Total Initiation Fee: R360 (R90 per month)
Total Admin Fees: R240 (R60 per month)
Total Cost: R3,000 + R2,025 + R360 + R240 = R5,625
Equal Monthly Payment: R5,625 ÷ 4 = R1,406.25

Monthly Breakdown (all months equal):
R750 (principal) + R506.25 (interest) + R90 (init) + R60 (admin) = R1,406.25
```

### 2. **Stockvel Loan Calculations (UPDATED v2.0 FINAL)**

#### Key Changes:
- **10% Minimum Interest** (kept as is)
- **Tiered calculation** DOUBLED:
  - >110% of savings: 30% (was 15%)
  - 105-110%: 25% (was 12.5%)
  - 75-105%: 20% (was 10%)
  - 50-75%: 15% (was 7.5%)
  - 25-50%: 8% (was 4%)
  - 5-25%: 3% (was 1.5%)
- **Initiation Fee:** WAIVED up to contributions, 12% on excess (distributed over term)
- **Equal Monthly Payments:** Total cost divided evenly across all months

#### Bonus System:
- If tiered rate < 10% minimum:
  - Member pays at the tiered rate
  - Admin fee adjusted: R60 × (1 - interest rate)
  - **Bonus** = Difference between minimum charge and actual charge
  - Bonus is added to member's contributions after payment received

#### Example 1: R3,000 loan with R5,000 savings (Loan < Savings)
```
Loan-to-Savings Ratio: 60% (50-75% tier = 15%)
Initiation Fee: R0 (WAIVED - loan ≤ savings)

Interest Calculation:
  Month 1: R3,000 × 15% = R450
  Month 2: R2,000 × 15% = R300
  Month 3: R1,000 × 15% = R150
  Total Interest: R900

Admin Fees (15% rate):
  R60 × (1 - 0.15) = R51 per month
  Total Admin: R153

Total Cost: R3,000 + R900 + R153 = R4,053
Equal Monthly Payment: R1,351
```

#### Example 2: R5,000 loan with R3,000 savings (Loan > Savings)
```
Loan-to-Savings Ratio: 167% (>110% tier = 30%)
Initiation Fee: (R5,000 - R3,000) × 12% = R240 (R80/month)

Interest Calculation:
  Month 1: R5,000 × 30% = R1,500
  Month 2: R3,333 × 30% = R1,000
  Month 3: R1,667 × 30% = R500
  Total Interest: R3,000

Admin Fees (30% rate):
  R60 × (1 - 0.30) = R42 per month
  Total Admin: R126

Total Cost: R5,000 + R3,000 + R240 + R126 = R8,366
Equal Monthly Payment: R2,788.67
```

## 🧮 Calculation Formula Changes

### Before (v1.0):
```
Interest Period = min(Math.ceil(term/2) >= 3 ? Math.ceil(term/2) : 3, term)
Interest = Sum of (Outstanding × 15%) for interest period
Initiation Fee = 9% of principal (standard)
Admin Fee = R60 per month
Monthly Payment = (Principal + Interest + Initiation + Admin) / term
```

### After (v2.0 FINAL):
```
Interest Period:
  - If term <= 3: Full term
  - If term > 3: max(Math.ceil(term/2), 3)

Interest Calculation:
  - Calculate 30% of declining balance for interest period
  - Spread total interest evenly across all months

Total Initiation Fee = Principal × 12%
Monthly Initiation = Total Initiation / term
Admin Fee = R60 per month

Total Cost = Principal + Total Interest + Total Initiation + Total Admin
Monthly Payment = Total Cost / term (EQUAL PAYMENTS)
```

### Stockvel Changes:
```
OLD Tiered Rates: 1.5% - 15%
NEW Tiered Rates: 3% - 30% (DOUBLED)

OLD Minimum: 10%
NEW Minimum: 10% (UNCHANGED)

OLD Initiation: 3% up to contributions + 9% on excess
NEW Initiation: WAIVED up to contributions, 12% on excess
```
