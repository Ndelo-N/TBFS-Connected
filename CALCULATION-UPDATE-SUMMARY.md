# TBFS Calculation Update Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Branch:** cursor/update-loan-and-stockvel-calculations-c11f

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Standard Loan Calculations (REVISED)**

#### New Calculation Method:
- **Monthly TBFS Income** = 30% of outstanding balance
- **Total Initiation Fee** = 12% of principal (distributed evenly over term)
- **Admin Fee** = R60 per month
- **Interest** = TBFS Income - Monthly Initiation Portion - Admin Fee

#### Example: R3,000 loan over 3 months
```
Month 1 (Outstanding R3,000):
  TBFS Income (30%): R900
    - Initiation: R120
    - Admin: R60
    - Interest: R720
  Principal Payment: R1,000
  Total Payment: R1,900

Month 2 (Outstanding R2,000):
  TBFS Income (30%): R600
    - Initiation: R120
    - Admin: R60
    - Interest: R420
  Principal Payment: R1,000
  Total Payment: R1,600

Month 3 (Outstanding R1,000):
  TBFS Income (30%): R300
    - Initiation: R120
    - Admin: R60
    - Interest: R120
  Principal Payment: R1,000
  Total Payment: R1,300

TOTALS:
  Total Interest: R1,260
  Total Initiation Fee: R360
  Total Admin Fees: R180
  Total TBFS Income: R1,800
  Total Paid: R4,800
```

### 2. **Stockvel Loan Calculations (UPDATED)**

#### Key Changes:
- **10% Minimum Interest** reinstated
- **Tiered calculation** still applies:
  - >110% of savings: 15%
  - 105-110%: 12.5%
  - 75-105%: 10%
  - 50-75%: 7.5%
  - 25-50%: 4%
  - 5-25%: 1.5%

#### Bonus System:
- If tiered rate < 10% minimum:
  - Member pays at the tiered rate
  - Admin fee adjusted: R60 × (1 - interest rate)
  - **Bonus** = Difference between minimum charge and actual charge
  - Bonus is added to member's contributions after payment received

#### Example: R3,000 loan with 5% calculated rate
```
Tiered calculation: 5% = R150 interest
Admin fee: R60 × (1 - 0.05) = R57
Total charged: R150 + R57 = R207

10% minimum would be: R300 interest + R60 admin = R360
Bonus to member: R360 - R207 = R153
```

### 3. **Stockvel Membership Tracking (NEW)**

Added fields for stockvel members:
- **Membership Start Date** (required)
- **Membership End Date** (auto-calculated: start date + 12 months)
- **Total Contributions** (tracked)

## 🧮 Calculation Formula Changes

### Before (OLD):
```
Interest Period = min(Math.ceil(term/2) >= 3 ? Math.ceil(term/2) : 3, term)
Interest = Sum of (Outstanding × 15%) for interest period
Initiation Fee = 9% of principal (standard)
Admin Fee = R60 per month
Monthly Payment = (Principal + Interest + Initiation + Admin) / term
```

### After (NEW):
```
Monthly TBFS Income = Outstanding Balance × 30%
Total Initiation Fee = Principal × 12% (distributed over term)
Monthly Initiation = Total Initiation / term
Admin Fee = R60 per month
Interest = TBFS Income - Monthly Initiation - Admin Fee
Monthly Payment = (Principal / term) + TBFS Income
```
