---

## 📋 Tiered Interest Structure

### How It Works:
The loan amount is broken into portions, with each portion charged at its rate based on the member's contribution level.

### Example: R10,500 Contributions

```
Tier 1: R0 - R3,150 (30% of R10,500) @ 3%
Tier 2: R3,150 - R7,875 (75% of R10,500) @ 8%
Tier 3: R7,875 - R11,025 (105% of R10,500) @ 15%
Tier 4: R11,025 - R11,550 (110% of R10,500) @ 25%
Tier 5: Above R11,550 @ 30%
```

### Example Calculation: R5,000 Loan
```
First R3,150 @ 3% = R94.50
Remaining R1,850 @ 8% = R148.00
Total = R242.50 per month (on initial balance)
```

Since 4.85% < 10% minimum:
- Member pays tiered rate (4.85%)
- Gets bonus for difference
- Bonus = (10% charge) - (actual charge)
