## ✅ ALL CHANGES COMPLETED

### 1. **🎁 Bonus Hidden (Surprise Feature)** ✅

#### What Changed:
- **Bonuses are NO LONGER visible** to members during loan calculations
- Bonuses are still calculated and tracked internally
- Members discover their bonuses when they receive their disbursement statement!

#### Where Hidden:
✅ Loan calculator display - bonus section commented out  
✅ Loan agreement PDF - bonus information removed  
✅ Benefits list - changed to "Special Member Benefits"  

#### What's Still Tracked:
✅ Bonus amounts calculated per month  
✅ Bonus added to contributions automatically  
✅ Bonus visible in admin stockvel tab  
✅ Bonus shown in member disbursement statements  

**Example:**
```
Before: "🎁 Member Bonus: R254.41 will be added to contributions"
After:  "Special Member Benefits: Additional rewards tracked automatically"
```

Members will be pleasantly surprised when they see their bonuses in the monthly statement! 🎉

---

### 2. **📅 Loan Due Date Fix** ✅

#### Problem:
- Loan made on 7th of month → Due date was 7th of next month
- Not aligned with month-end business cycles

#### Solution:
- **Due dates are now the LAST DAY of the selected start month**
- Works for all month lengths (28, 29, 30, 31 days)
- Properly handles year transitions

#### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Example: Loan disbursed on Oct 7, 2025, Start Month = November
// OLD: Due date = Nov 7, 2025
// NEW: Due date = Nov 30, 2025 (last day of November)

// For subsequent payments:
// Payment 2: Dec 31, 2025
// Payment 3: Jan 31, 2026
// etc.
```

#### Code Changes:
- ✅ Added `start_month_index` to loan records
- ✅ Updated due date calculation to use `new Date(year, month+1, 0)`
- ✅ Handles year rollover correctly
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing loans

---
