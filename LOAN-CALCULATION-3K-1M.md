## 💰 Tiered Interest Calculation

Breaking down the R3,000 loan across all tiers:

| Tier | Range | Amount in Tier | Rate | Interest |
|------|-------|----------------|------|----------|
| 1 | R0 - R450 | **R450** | 3% | R13.50 |
| 2 | R450 - R1,125 | **R675** | 8% | R54.00 |
| 3 | R1,125 - R1,575 | **R450** | 15% | R67.50 |
| 4 | R1,575 - R1,650 | **R75** | 25% | R18.75 |
| 5 | Above R1,650 | **R1,350** | 30% | **R405.00** |
| **TOTAL** | | **R3,000** | | **R558.75** |

### Effective Rate
- **Tiered Interest:** R558.75
- **Effective Rate:** 558.75 / 3,000 = **18.625%**

## 🔍 Which Calculation Method Applies?

### Check for 30% Tier Application:
- **Effective Rate:** 18.625%
- **Is it 30%?** ❌ NO
- **Why?** Only R1,350 of the R3,000 is charged at 30%, the rest is at lower rates
- **Result:** Use **10% minimum + bonus system** (NOT Income Table method)

## 📋 Month 1 Calculation (Full Term)

### Step 1: Calculate Components

**Outstanding Balance:** R3,000

**1. Tiered Interest:** R558.75 (calculated above)

**2. Check 10% Minimum:**
- 10% of R3,000 = R300
- Tiered interest R558.75 > R300 ✅
- **Use tiered interest** (higher than minimum)

**3. Calculate Admin Fee:**
- Effective rate = 18.625%
- Admin fee = R60 × (1 - 0.18625) = R60 × 0.81375
- **Admin fee = R48.83** (approximately)

**4. Initiation Fee:**
- Loan R3,000 > Contributions R1,500
- Initiation on excess = (R3,000 - R1,500) × 12% = R1,500 × 0.12
- **Total initiation = R180**
- For 1 month: **R180/1 = R180**

**5. Bonus Calculation:**
- Amount due to TBFS = R558.75 + R48.83 + R180 = **R787.58**
- 10% minimum charge = R300 + R60 + R180 = **R540**
- **Tiered charge (R787.58) > Minimum charge (R540)**
- **Bonus = R0** (tiered rate is ABOVE minimum, so no bonus!)

## 💳 Payment Breakdown

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Principal** | R3,000.00 | Full repayment |
| **Interest** | R558.75 | Tiered calculation (18.625% effective) |
| **Admin Fee** | R48.83 | R60 × (1 - 0.18625) |
| **Initiation Fee** | R180.00 | 12% on R1,500 excess |
| **Bonus Earned** | **R0** | Tiered > minimum (no bonus) |
| **TOTAL PAYMENT** | **R3,787.58** | One-time payment |

## 📊 Comparison: What if 30% Tier Rule Applied?

**Hypothetical: If entire loan was treated as 30% tier (Income Table method):**

| Component | Current (Tiered) | If 30% Method | Difference |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| TBFS Income | - | R900.00 (30% total) | - |
| Interest | R558.75 | R660.00 | +R101.25 |
| Admin Fee | R48.83 | R60.00 | +R11.17 |
| Initiation | R180.00 | R180.00 | R0 |
| **Total Due** | **R787.58** | **R900.00** | **+R112.42** |

**Current tiered method is CHEAPER by R112.42!** ✅

## 🎯 Key Insights

### Why No Bonus?
The tiered interest (18.625%) is **above the 10% minimum**, so:
- Member pays the actual tiered rate
- No bonus awarded (bonuses only when rate < 10%)
- This is fair because the loan is 2× the contributions

### Why Not 30% Tier Rule?
- **Only R1,350** of the R3,000 is charged at 30%
- The rest (R1,650) is charged at lower rates (3%, 8%, 15%, 25%)
- **Effective rate: 18.625%** ≠ 30%
- So it doesn't trigger the "30% = total charge" rule

### Is This Fair?
✅ **YES!** The member benefits from:
1. First R1,650 charged at favorable rates (3%-25%)
2. Only the excess R1,350 charged at 30%
3. Initiation fee waived on first R1,500
4. Admin fee reduced to R48.83 (not R60)
5. **Total cost: R3,787.58** instead of R4,020 with pure 30% method

## 💡 How to Improve This Loan

**To get bonuses, the member needs:**
- Higher initial contributions (to get tiered rate below 10%)
- OR longer term (to grow savings and reduce balance)

**Example:** If this member had:
- **R2,500 contributions** instead of R1,500
- Loan/Savings = 120% (only slightly above 110%)
- Would hit mainly 25% and 30% tiers
- Might stay above 10%, still no bonus

**OR:**
- **R3,000+ contributions** (100% coverage)
- Would be in 15% tier or lower
- 10% minimum would apply
- **Bonuses earned!**
