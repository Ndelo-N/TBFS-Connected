## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

### **On Mobile/Tablet:**

- [ ] **Swipe left** to go to next tab (Calculator → Dashboard → Clients → etc.)
- [ ] **Swipe right** to go to previous tab (reverse direction)
- [ ] **Watch for arrow indicators** appearing on sides during swipe
- [ ] **Check arrows pulse** when you swipe far enough (100px+)
- [ ] **Verify smooth animations** when tabs switch
- [ ] **Test tab still works** when you click the buttons normally
- [ ] **Try swiping in Income Table tab** (should not interfere with iframe)
- [ ] **Swipe while scrolling** (should distinguish vertical vs horizontal)
- [ ] **Test in forms** (swipe shouldn't trigger while typing/selecting)

### **On Desktop:**

- [ ] **Press Left Arrow key** to go to previous tab
- [ ] **Press Right Arrow key** to go to next tab
- [ ] **Verify animations** play smoothly
- [ ] **Arrow keys don't work** when typing in input fields (correct behavior)
- [ ] **Regular tab clicks** still work normally

### **Edge Cases:**

- [ ] **First tab** (Calculator): Can't swipe right (no previous tab)
- [ ] **Last tab** (Settings): Can't swipe left (no next tab)
- [ ] **Short swipes** (< 100px): Snap back, don't switch tabs
- [ ] **Vertical scrolling** still works normally
- [ ] **Forms inputs** not affected by swipe

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators**

### **What to Look For:**

1. **Start Swiping:**
   - Arrow appears on the side (◀ or ▶)
   - Faint/transparent at first

2. **Swipe Further (50px+):**
   - Arrow becomes more visible
   - Indicates direction detected

3. **Swipe Even More (100px+):**
   - Arrow pulses/grows (ready to switch)
   - Release to change tabs

4. **Release Before 100px:**
   - Arrows fade out
   - No tab change (snap back)

---

## 🐛 **Known Limitations**

1. **Income Table iframe:** Swipe detection doesn't work inside the iframe. Need to swipe on the main content or header area.
2. **Desktop touchscreen:** If you have a touchscreen desktop, both touch and arrow keys work.
3. **Old browsers:** Requires modern browser with touch event support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
