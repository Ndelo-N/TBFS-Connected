# 🐛 Bug Test Report - Stockvel Member System

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Branch:** `feature/separate-stockvel-member-system`  
**Testing Status:** ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

---

## ✅ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### 1. ❌ → ✅ **Case Sensitivity Error**
**Error:** `appState is not defined`  
**Cause:** Used lowercase `appState` instead of `AppState`  
**Fixed:** Changed all references to `AppState`  
**Impact:** Stockvel tab now loads without crashing

### 2. ❌ → ✅ **Duplicate Variable Declaration**
**Error:** Global `stockvelReceipts` variable conflicting with AppState  
**Cause:** Old variable from previous system  
**Fixed:** Removed global variable, all use `AppState.stockvelReceipts`  
**Impact:** Data persistence now works correctly

### 3. ❌ → ✅ **Double Prefix Issue**
**Error:** `AppState.AppState.stockvelReceipts` created by sed  
**Cause:** Over-aggressive replacement  
**Fixed:** Cleaned up all double prefixes  
**Impact:** No runtime errors

### 4. ❌ → ✅ **Filter Mismatch**
**Error:** History filtering by `accountNumber` instead of `memberNumber`  
**Cause:** Copy-paste from old client system  
**Fixed:** Changed to filter by `memberNumber`  
**Impact:** Contribution history filtering works correctly

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### **Not Critical, But Note:**

1. **Console.log statements:** 128 found
   - Helpful for debugging
   - Consider removing for production
   - Not breaking anything

2. **Old client-based stockvel:** Still exists
   - For backward compatibility
   - Old clients with isStockvelMember flag
   - Works alongside new system

3. **Member matching:** Uses name/phone
   - Works but could be more robust
   - Consider adding manual selection
   - Good enough for now
